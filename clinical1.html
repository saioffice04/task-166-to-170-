    <p class="align">In biomedical image registration, the most frequently used interpolation methods include
        nearest neighbor, linear, bilinear, trilinear, cubic, bicubic, tricubic, quadrilinear, and cubic
        convolution interpolation. The more complex the interpolation methods, the more
        surrounding points concerned, and the slower the registration speed. In order to speed
        up the registration procedure, low cost interpolation techniques are often preferred.
        Because of its good trade-off between accuracy and computational complexity, the
        bilinear interpolation is the most commonly used method (Zitová and Flusser, 2003).
        According to the research of Thévenaz, Blu, and Unser (2000), in cardiac and thorax image
        registration, trilinear interpolation can help to achieve good registration performance</p>
        <p class="align">The optimization algorithm is required by almost every registration procedure, which
            serves as a searching strategy. There are several optimization algorithms often used in
            the biomedical image registration. The exhaustive searching method has been selected
            as optimization strategy by researchers. However, because of its high computational
            complexity, the exhaustive method for searching for the global optimization is not an
            efficient choice. The Powell algorithm by Powell (1964) and Simplex method by Nelder and
            Mead (1965) are more efficient than the exhaustive searching strategy in finding an
            optimum solution</p>
            <p class="align">The Powell algorithm has been used frequently as an optimization strategy for biomedical
                image registration, for example, Collignon et al. (1995), Maes, Collignon, Vandermeulen,
                Marchal, and Suetens (1997), Wang and Feng (2005). The Powell algorithm performs a
                succession of one-dimensional optimizations, finding in turn the best solution along
                each freedom degree, and then returning to the first degree of freedom. The algorithm
                stops when it is unable to find a new solution with a significant improvement to the
                current solution.</p>
                <p class="align">The Downhill-Simplex algorithm has been used by, for example, Hill et al. (1993) and van
                    Herk and Kooy (1994). Rohlfing and Maurer (2003) adopted a variant of the DownhillSimplex algorithm restricted to the direction of the steepest ascent.</p>
                  <p class="align">In order to search a vast number of parameters, which represent the complex deformation
                    fields, multi-resolution optimization algorithms have been adopted by researchers in the
                    biomedical image registration community, for example, Penny (1998). Initially, the
                    registration is performed at coarse spatial scales, then to the finer ones. These multiresolution or coarse-to-fine optimization algorithms can accelerate computation and help
                    to escape from the local minima.</p> <br>

                    <p class="align">For all types of registration, assessment of the registration accuracy is very important.
                        A medical image registration method cannot be accepted as a clinical tool to make
                        decisions about patient management until it has been proved to be accurate enough.
                        Important criteria for assessing the performance of registration schemes are accuracy,
                        robustness, usability, and computational complexity. The often used validation methods
                        include Fiducial landmarks, Phantom studies, and Visual inspection.</p>
                        <p class="align">Fiducial landmarks, which can predict the expected error distribution, have been devised
                            to assess the registration accuracy. To a certain extent, assessment using fiducial
                            landmarks provides a “gold standard” for medical image registration. However, the
                            fiducial landmarks can either suffer from the movement of skin mobility or are highly
                            invasive. Also, these validation measures cannot be applied retrospectively</p>
                            <p class="align">Phantom studies are important for the estimation of the registration accuracy because
                                the data and displacement information is fully known beforehand. Phantom-based
                                validations provide measures for mean transformation errors and computational complexity for different methods, and they are especially useful for estimating the accuracy
                                of intra-modality registration methods.</p>
                                <p class="align">Visual inspection, which provides a qualitative assessment, is the most intuitive method
                                    for evaluation of the registration accuracy. This assessment method may involve the
                                    inspection of subtraction images, contour overlays, or viewing anatomical landmarks. It
                                    has been used widely in both rigid and non-rigid registration assessment, but it may be
                                    considered as an informal and insufficient approach.</p>
                                    <p class="align">Researchers have been developing novel and practical validation techniques, for
                                        example, Hellier, Barillot, Memin and Perez (2001) proposed a hierarchical estimation
                                        method for 3-D registration. The measurement of the consistency of transformations has
                                        been proposed to serve as accuracy qualification method by, for example, Holden et al.
                                        (2000). Wang, Feng, Yeh, and Huang (2001) proposed a novel automatic method to
                                        estimate confidence intervals of the resulting registration parameters and allow the
                                        precision of registration results to be objectively assessed for 2-D and 3-D medical
                                        images. Fitzpatrick, Hill, and Maurer (2000); Mäkelä, Clarysse, Sipilä, Pauna, Pham, Katila,
                                        and Magnin (2002), and Zitová and Flusser (2003) presented good discussions and
                                        summaries about performance validation methods for medical image registration</p>
                                        <p class="align">However, validation of registration accuracy is a difficult task because of the lack of the
                                            ground truth. Objective performance validation still remains a challenge in the field of
                                            biomedical image registration.</p>
